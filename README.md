# Warframe Notifier

This was a to keep track of what items are currently available in the MMO Warframe, and notify you if an item of interest was currently up for grabs.

At the time there were a number mission-rewards that were more rare than others, and if you were farming them, your options were to either stay logged in all the time, or spend hours building a program that would watch for you.

## Project Defunct

I haven't played Warframe in a long time, and the API this depends upon has definitly had breaking changes since then.

If I get way into this game again, I may update this.
